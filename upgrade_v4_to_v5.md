# Upgrade Guide: v4 to v5

This document outlines the changes and steps required to upgrade from version v4 to v5 of the fuel consumption prediction model.

## Key Changes

* **Improved Model Accuracy:** The underlying prediction model has been significantly improved, resulting in more accurate fuel consumption predictions.  This involved retraining the model with a larger and more diverse dataset, and incorporating advanced techniques to handle outliers and improve model generalization.  The new model uses a RandomForestRegressor instead of a Linear Regression model.

* **Enhanced Data Preprocessing:** The data preprocessing pipeline has been refined to handle missing values and noisy data more effectively.  This includes the implementation of new data cleaning and transformation techniques, leading to a more robust and reliable model.  Techniques such as imputation for missing values and standardization for numerical features were employed.

* **New Features:**  The model now incorporates additional features, such as weather conditions and fuel type, to enhance prediction accuracy.  These new features were carefully selected based on their correlation with fuel consumption.  Feature selection techniques were used to identify the most relevant features.

* **API Enhancements:** The API has been updated to support the new features and improved model.  This includes changes to the request and response formats, as well as improved error handling.  The API now includes more detailed error messages and better input validation.

## Upgrade Steps

1. **Backup:** Before upgrading, back up your existing project files.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed.  Refer to the `requirements.txt` file for a complete list.

3. **Update Code:** Replace the old model files (`model_v4.joblib`, `predict_v4.py`) with the new model files (`model_v5.joblib`, `predict_v5.py`).

4. **Update API:** Update the API code to handle the new features and request/response formats.

5. **Test:** Thoroughly test the upgraded model and API to ensure everything is working correctly.


## Mathematical Details

The v5 model uses a RandomForestRegressor, which is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

**Decision Tree:** A single decision tree recursively partitions the data based on feature values to create leaf nodes that represent predictions.  The prediction for a given data point is determined by traversing the tree based on its feature values until reaching a leaf node.

**Random Forest:** A random forest combines multiple decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data and features.  This reduces overfitting and improves the model's generalization ability.  The final prediction is the average of the predictions from all the individual trees.

The model is trained using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.  The MSE is calculated as:

**MSE = (1/n) * Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)²**

Where:

* n: Number of samples
* yᵢ: Actual fuel consumption
* ŷᵢ: Predicted fuel consumption

**Feature Importance:** RandomForestRegressor provides feature importance scores, indicating the relative contribution of each feature to the model's predictions.  This information can be used to select the most relevant features and improve model performance.


## Potential Neural Network Architectures for Future Improvements

For future improvements, we can explore the use of neural networks.  A simple feedforward neural network could be used, with one or more hidden layers.  The activation function in the hidden layers could be ReLU, and the output layer would use a linear activation function.  The loss function would be MSE, and the optimizer could be Adam.

**Example Architecture:**

* Input Layer:  Number of neurons equal to the number of features (including one-hot encoded categorical features).
* Hidden Layer 1:  Number of neurons (e.g., 64 or 128).  ReLU activation function.
* Hidden Layer 2:  Number of neurons (e.g., 32 or 64).  ReLU activation function.
* Output Layer: 1 neuron (linear activation function).


The specific architecture would need to be determined through experimentation and hyperparameter tuning.  More complex architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), could also be explored depending on the nature of the data and the desired level of accuracy.
